\chapter*{Abstract}

With the shift towards Industry 4.0 and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), providing assurance guarantees is becoming more challenging.\\
Safety-critical industries and the increasing IoT applications require making critical decisions and exchanging huge amounts of data in real-time.
Unavailable bandwidth and/or untimely responses in the networks deployed in such fields may lead to undesired or even catastrophic outcomes\\
The latest future communication technologies, e.g. Time-sensitive Networking TSN, 5G and Cyber-Physical Security (CPS),
aim towards meeting the requirements of the next generation industry as deterministic and critical machine-to-machine
communications while ensuring advanced cybersecurity.\\
However, the traditional network monitoring solutions aren't suitable for evaluating the new network technologies targetting real-time communications.
We survey some state-of-the-arts, review present network monitoring and benchmarking solutions, and identify open problems of monitoring real-time networks.\\
We propose a benchmarking and monitoring system that uses the extended Berkeley Packet Filter eBPF technology to achieve real-time network monitoring.\\
This work serves as a feasibility study on eBPF in real-time networks and provides an applied analysis foundation for the design and maintenance of real-time networks
with the help of visualizations and metrics from the monitoring system.\\
