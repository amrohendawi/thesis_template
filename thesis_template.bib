While the bus load increases, the transmission of the lower priority messages may experience variable delays (jitter) or even may be unable to be transmitted. Even at maximum load, the transmission of such messages has to be guaranteed and the delivery time has to be determined with high precision. CANopen is an industrial event-driven network based on Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol at the physical and data link communication levels. A time-triggered software extension of CANopen based on Time-Triggered CAN is described in this paper, as well as its implementation on an embedded networked system based on microcontrollers.},

  abstract = {Network monitoring guides network operators in understanding the current behavior of a network. Therefore, accurate and efficient monitoring is vital to ensure that the network operates according to the intended behavior and then to troubleshoot any deviations. However, the current practice of network-monitoring largely depends on manual operations, and thus enterprises spend a significant portion of their budgets on the workforce that monitor their networks. We analyze present network-monitoring technologies, identify open problems, and suggest future directions. In particular, our findings are based on two different analyses. The first analysis assesses how well present technologies integrate with the entire cycle of network-management operations: design, deployment, and monitoring. Network operators first design network configurations, given a set of requirements, then they deploy the new design, and finally they verify it by continuously monitoring the network’s behavior. One of our observations is that the efficiency of this cycle can be greatly improved by automated deployment of pre-designed configurations, in response to changes in monitored network behavior. Our second analysis focuses on network-monitoring technologies and group issues in these technologies into five categories. Such grouping leads to the identification of major problem groups in network monitoring, e.g., efficient management of increasing amounts of measurements for storage, analysis, and presentation. We argue that continuous effort is needed in improving network-monitoring since the presented problems will become even more serious in the future, as networks grow in size and carry more data.}
